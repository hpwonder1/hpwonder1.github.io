## Model

### Model Detail

 - The model built are ```ABMs (agent-based models)```, which are often used in social and ecological sciences. 
 - The code of the model includes: agent code, model code and environment code. For this project, I writed the model code and environment code into the ```model.py``` file, and the agent code into the ```agentframwork.py``` file. The ```in.csv``` file provides data used to construct the environmental space. Finally, ```video.gif``` shows the process and results of running the model.
 - The model provides the following functions:
    1. Customize ```num_of_agents```, ```num_of_iterations``` and ```neighborhood```.
    2. Provide the menu ```Model```, and provide the ```Run_Model``` button, click to run the model until the stop condition is reached.
