## Model

### Model Detail

The model built are ***ABMs (agent-based models)***, which are often used in social and ecological sciences. 
The code of the model includes: agent code, model code and environment code. For this project, I writed the model code and environment code into the ```model.py``` file, and the agent code into the ```agentframwork.py``` file. The ```in.csv``` file provides data used to construct the environmental space. Finally, ```video.gif``` shows the process and results of running the model.
